-- to do list:
---------

done: 1. when selecting new connection - recreate empty graph and clear metrics list (it already re-builds easyautocomplete)
done: 2. when removing last selected metrics also empty the graph
done: 3. color selected metrics in the chart colors
done: 4. sql: modify to include derived items
done: 4a sql: modify to replace null with something (check dygraph doc - NaN ??)
done: 5. move out event logic into a function
5. can i compare charts from diff databases ?
    This would require combining datasets on client, i.e. in javascript; may be slow ??
	alternatively can be combined in python after selecting from several databases; 
	this may also be slow since there will be no data streaming
6. add "to remove metrics from chart click on metric below" on the bottom
done: 7. add units on the bottom 
done: 8. prevent from selecting second time already selected metrics
9. make static "Overview" tab with Logical Reads per Sec, Redo per Sec, Physical
10. display error when python can not connect to oracle (like ewptsdb_prod with no tunnel)
10a. why datapoint hover overlay is outside of the chart ?
done: 11. Title and Units labels are misleading on multi-series chart
done: 12. multi-instance (RAC): add inst_id checkbox on bottom; 
done: 13: add "ALL" instances in sql; for derived it is tricky
done: 14: add SQL_MONITOR datatable
15: repaint SQL_MONITOR on zoomEnd and panEnd events
	There are no such events; 
	check https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dygraphs-users/I-wNDXZjCls
	check http://kaliatech.github.io/dygraphs-dynamiczooming-example/
done: 16: shade area on chart while hovering over sql in SQL_MONITOR datatable
17: to speed up chart loading time:
	separate data for full range from data for visible dateWindow
		for full range - take from DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_SUMMARY where its aggregated by AWR snap
		for visible viewport - take from DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_HISTORY
		splice the two data sources before feeding to dyGraph
